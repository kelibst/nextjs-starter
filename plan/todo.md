let's review our initial plan, and seed how far we have come. base on our currently implementations. lets reviww the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and see features, we need to add and those that we need to improve and update the plan. let's plan first.

I want you to review our current implementation of the roles and permission. How can we improve it to the same level as wordpress roles and permissions assignment where the user can add features then proceed to to assign specific permission to users. users can even add more roles? let's plan it properly. 

Only 8 optional feature branches from the original plan:
Email Verification (1-2 days)
Password Reset (1-2 days)
Rate Limiting (1-2 days)
Two-Factor Authentication (2-3 days)
OAuth - Google/GitHub (2-3 days)
Magic Link (1-2 days)
API Keys (2 days)
Enhanced Audit Logging (1 day)


awesome, here I need to add theme selection. we need to make a great plan so that the user can select a theme they want during development and even they can still choose themes later on on the dashboard. but the theme they select will use consistent colors and fonts and all. so how can we achieve that? is development theme selection better? so that it will be easier to implement.
