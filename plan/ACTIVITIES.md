# Project Activities Log

This file tracks major features and changes implemented in the Next.js Authentication Starter Kit.

## 2025-11-01

### ✅ Project Planning Phase
**Time:** Initial Planning
**Description:** Established project structure and created comprehensive implementation plan for Next.js authentication starter kit with opt-in feature branches.

**Key Decisions:**
- Core authentication: Custom JWT implementation
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- UI: Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- Architecture: Git branch-based feature opt-in system
- Testing: Playwright for E2E tests

**Technical Notes:**
- Main branch contains minimal working auth (username/password + JWT)
- Each additional feature lives in its own branch for easy cherry-picking
- Users clone and merge branches for features they need
- Documentation generated with Context7

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup
**Time:** Implementation Start
**Description:** Completed core project infrastructure including dependencies, database setup, and project structure.

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Updated package.json with all core dependencies (Prisma, bcrypt, jose, Zod, React Hook Form, Shadcn/ui)

### ⚙️ Next.js 16 Migration: Middleware → Proxy
**Time:** Migration
**Description:** Migrated from deprecated `middleware.ts` to new `proxy.ts` convention in Next.js 16.

**What Changed:**
- Renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`
- Changed exported function from `middleware()` to `proxy()`
- Updated comments to reflect proxy terminology
- No functional changes to authentication logic

**Technical Notes:**
- Next.js 16 deprecated the "middleware" convention in favor of "proxy"
- The term "proxy" better describes the feature's actual behavior (Edge Runtime network boundary)
- Prevents confusion with Express.js-style middleware patterns
- Maintains all existing route protection, authentication, and role-based access logic

**Files Changed:**
- Deleted: [middleware.ts](../middleware.ts)
- Created: [proxy.ts](../proxy.ts) - Edge Runtime proxy for route protection

**Why This Matters:**
- Removes deprecation warning: "The 'middleware' file convention is deprecated. Please use 'proxy' instead."
- Future-proofs the codebase for Next.js 16+
- Aligns with Next.js best practices

### 🔧 Bug Fix: Install Missing Shadcn/ui Components
**Time:** Bug Fix
**Description:** Fixed "Module not found" errors by installing all required Shadcn/ui components.

**Issue:**
Application was failing to compile with error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/button'
```

**Root Cause:**
During initial setup, Shadcn/ui components were referenced in code but not all were explicitly installed.

**Components Installed:**
- [components/ui/button.tsx](../components/ui/button.tsx) - Button component
- [components/ui/input.tsx](../components/ui/input.tsx) - Input component
- [components/ui/label.tsx](../components/ui/label.tsx) - Label component
- [components/ui/badge.tsx](../components/ui/badge.tsx) - Badge component
- [components/ui/avatar.tsx](../components/ui/avatar.tsx) - Avatar component
- [components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx](../components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx) - Dropdown menu
- [components/ui/form.tsx](../components/ui/form.tsx) - Form wrapper with React Hook Form

**Command Used:**
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button input label card badge dropdown-menu avatar form
```

**Resolution:**
All UI component imports now resolve correctly. Application compiles and runs without errors.

## 2025-11-02

### ✅ Security Refactor: Repository Pattern Implementation
**Time:** Morning
**Description:** Eliminated direct Prisma database access across the entire codebase and implemented a secure repository pattern to prevent accidental password exposure and centralize security policies.

**Security Issues Identified:**
- Direct Prisma imports in 11 files (API routes + session.ts)
- No centralized access control
- Risk of password field exposure
- No audit trail for database queries
- Difficult to add features like rate limiting or soft deletes
- Testing challenges (can't mock database easily)
- Inconsistent query patterns across codebase

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Repository Pattern** - Centralized data access layer
- **Automatic Password Exclusion** - UserRepository never exposes password fields by default
- **Audit Middleware** - Query logging and performance monitoring
- **Type-Safe Operations** - Full TypeScript coverage with proper generics
- **Transaction Support** - Built into base repository

**Files Created (9 new files):**
1. lib/repositories/base.repository.ts - Abstract base with common CRUD operations

3. lib/repositories/refresh-token.repository.ts - Token management
4. lib/repositories/invite.repository.ts - Invite operations
5. lib/repositories/index.ts - Centralized exports (ONLY place to import repositories)
6. lib/db/middleware/audit.middleware.ts - Query logging and performance monitoring

**Files Refactored (11 files - ALL direct Prisma access removed):**
1. lib/auth/session.ts - Now uses userRepository + refreshTokenRepository
2. app/api/auth/register/route.ts - Now uses userRepository
3. app/api/auth/login/route.ts - Now uses userRepository
4. app/api/users/route.ts - Now uses userRepository (with pagination support)
5. app/api/users/[id]/route.ts - Now uses userRepository (GET, PATCH, DELETE)
6. app/api/users/me/route.ts - Now uses userRepository
7. app/api/users/me/password/route.ts - Now uses userRepository (with password access)
8. app/api/admin/stats/route.ts - Now uses userRepository
9. app/api/admin/invites/route.ts - Now uses userRepository + inviteRepository
10. lib/db/prisma.ts - Updated to register audit middleware
11. app/(admin)/layout.tsx - Fixed React.ReactNode type
